# Vision
To provide a framework/starter template for JBox Applications
Key features:
- Angular/PrimeNG Frontend
- SpringBoot Java (kotlin) Backend
- gradle build
- modular (builds monolith but quickly extracted to microservices)
- monorepo
- pipeline integration (docker container pushed to registry)
- onion architecture
- cqrs
- most RDBMS Systems supported out of the box (MySQL, Postgres, MSSQL, Oracle etc)
- Azure AD auth via appreg
- Modular OpenApi (generated)
- User/Role/Permission
- Sherlog/Azure app insights integration (terraform)
- Actuator prometheus monitoring
- Tracing
- versioning
- coding style and check
- test coverage

This is the starter monorepo for JBox Standard projects.
To start a new project, pull it from the Azure repo and the push it to a new origin.

`insert git command here`
